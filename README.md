# GEMSS - Generator of Enriched Multi-Sphere Shapes

`GEMSS` creates overlapping-sphere representations of arbitrary 3D geometries based on voxelized Euclidean distance transforms (EDT) and feature-enhanced distance transform (FEDT) fields. It **enriches** the output with physical metadata—including Center of Mass (CoM), Inertia Tensors, and Principal Moments—necessary for high-fidelity Discrete Element Method (DEM) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

**This repository is a fork of the [Python implementation by Felix Buchele](https://github.com/FelixBuchele/multisphere).**

## Features

- Multisphere reconstruction according to MSS algorithm [1] from:
  - Triangle meshes (binary STL) 
  - Binary voxel grids
- Physical Property Computation: Automated calculation of volume, Center of Mass (CoM), inertia tensors, and principal axes directly from the multisphere union or the target geometry.
- Topology Filtering: Built-in pruning of isolated sphere networks to guarantee continuous rigid-body representations.
- Multiple termination criteria:
  - Shape precision
  - Maximum number of spheres
  - Minimum allowed sphere radius
- Robust Generalized Winding Number voxelization (via libigl)
- OpenMP parallelization for voxelization and field processing
- Export formats:
  - CSV (sphere centers & radii)
  - VTK (visualization)
  - STL (mesh export)

## Scientific Background

The MSS algorithm is based on:
- Voxelization of the target geometry
- Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT)
- Iterative residual correction using the Feature-Enhanced Distance Transform (FEDT)
- Termination by shape accuracy, minimum radius, or maximum sphere count

The use of FEDT preserves the medial axis of the geometry and avoids the major drawbacks of greedy sphere removal methods, such as spurious small spheres and symmetry violations.

## C++ Implementation

The C++ implementation is designed for high-performance integration. It is a **pure header-only** library. All necessary third-party mathematics and geometry processing headers are bundled in the `thirdparty/` directory, with the sole exception of Eigen.

### ⚠️ Critical Performance Requirement

Because `GEMSS` relies heavily on massive voxel-space iterations and 3D distance transforms, **you must compile your code with aggressive optimizations enabled (`-O3` on GCC/Clang, or `/Ox` on MSVC)**. 

Without optimizations, the compiler will not inline the geometry math or vectorize the spatial hashing loops. Processing 1,000,000 query points takes approximately **10 seconds** with `-O3`, but will take **over 10 minutes** without it. Do not evaluate the performance of this library in an unoptimized state.

### Dependencies

* **System**: CMake (≥3.15), C++17 compiler, OpenMP (optional but highly recommended).
* **Bundled (in `GEMSS/thirdparty/`)**: `libigl` (math/geometry), `edt` (distance transform).
* **Not bundled:** [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) (required, must be installed separately).

## Step-by-Step Integration Guide

Because this is a header-only library, you do not need to pre-compile anything to use it in your own software. Below is the exact process to integrate and compile your own code using `GEMSS`.

### Option A: Using CMake (Recommended)

**Step 1:** Set up your project directory. Copy the `GEMSS` folder into your project's `include` directory (or any directory you use for external headers).
```text
my_project/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main.cpp
└── include/
    └── GEMSS/  <-- Copy GEMSS here
```

**Step 2:** Update your `CMakeLists.txt` to add the GEMSS directory to your include paths and link Eigen.
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(MyMultisphereApp LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

# Find required external dependency
find_package(Eigen3 3.3 REQUIRED NO_MODULE)

# Add GEMSS header-only library
add_subdirectory(include/GEMSS)

# Create your executable(s)
add_executable(my_app main.cpp)

# Link GEMSS header-only library
# GEMSS handles all include paths internally
# Link Eigen (GEMSS is header-only)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE multisphere_lib Eigen3::Eigen)

# FORCE OPTIMIZATIONS for your executable (Critical!)
if(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "GNU|Clang")
    target_compile_options(my_app PRIVATE -O3 -march=native)
elseif(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID MATCHES "MSVC")
    target_compile_options(my_app PRIVATE /Ox /Oi /Ot)
endif()
```

**Step 3:** Build your code from the terminal.
```bash
cd my_project
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . -j4
./my_app
```

### Option B: Compiling Directly with G++ (Command Line)

If you do not want to use CMake, you can compile your code directly via the terminal. You must explicitly provide the include paths for GEMSS, its bundled `thirdparty` files, and `Eigen3`.

Assuming GEMSS is in your include directory:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -march=native -fopenmp main.cpp \
    -I include/GEMSS/ \
    -I include/GEMSS/thirdparty/ \
    -I include/GEMSS/thirdparty/igl \
    -I /usr/include/eigen3/ \
    -o my_app
```
*(Note: Replace `/usr/include/eigen3/` with the actual path to your Eigen installation if it differs).*

#### Enabling Internal Debug Prints

If you need to track internal library execution (such as function calls and intermediate values), enable the `GEMSS_DEBUG` flag. 

If using CMake, pass the option during configuration:
```bash
cmake ../src -DGEMSS_DEBUG=ON
```

If compiling directly with G++, pass the definition flag:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O3 -march=native -fopenmp -DGEMSS_DEBUG main.cpp ...
```

## Basic C++ Usage

The core API is provided via the umbrella header `GEMSS-interface.h` and is contained entirely within the `GEMSS` namespace.

```cpp
#include "GEMSS-interface.h"
#include <iostream>

using namespace GEMSS;

int main() {
  // 1. Load Mesh
  FastMesh mesh = load_mesh_fast("example_mesh.stl");

  // 2. Set up configuration
  MultisphereConfig config;
  config.div = 150;                   // Voxel grid resolution
  config.padding = 2;                 // Grid padding
  config.min_radius_vox = 8;          // Minimum sphere radius in voxels
  config.precision_target = 0.99;     // Target precision
  config.min_center_distance_vox = 4; // Minimum center distance in voxels
  config.max_spheres = 100;           // Maximum number of spheres
  config.show_progress = true;        // Show progress output
  config.confine_mesh = false;        // Do not confine spheres to mesh boundary
  config.prune_isolated_spheres = true; // Remove disconnected spheres
  config.compute_physics = 1;         // Compute physics (1 = based on reconstruction)

  // 3. Run Reconstruction
  SpherePack sp = multisphere_from_mesh(mesh, config);

  // 4. Access Computed Physics Properties
  std::cout << "Reconstruction Volume: " << sp.volume << "\n";
  std::cout << "Center of Mass:\n" << sp.center_of_mass << "\n";
  std::cout << "Inertia Tensor:\n" << sp.inertia_tensor << "\n";

  // 5. Export
  export_to_csv(sp, "results.csv");
  export_to_vtk(sp, "results.vtk");

  return 0;
}
```

## Input/Output

- **Mesh loading:** STL (binary) files via `load_mesh_fast`
- **Export:** CSV, VTK, STL (no runtime visualization; use external tools for viewing)

### Visualization

You can visualize the output files using external tools such as [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) (for VTK), [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/) (for STL), or any spreadsheet software (for CSV).  
No runtime visualization is included in this library.


### Details of the config 

    persistence (int): > Defines the solver's "patience" when it stops finding new features.

        Value = 1: The solver stops immediately if a standard search finds no new peaks.

        Value > 1: If no peaks are found, the solver will amplify the missing details and retry up to N times.

        Recommendation: Use higher values for complex geometries where small details are hard to detect at base resolution.

See the `LICENSE` file for full details.

`multisphere-cpp` depends on third-party libraries with compatible licenses:

| Package | License | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Eigen** | MPL2 | C++ Math |
| **libigl** | MPL2 | C++ Voxelization |
| **edt** | LGPL3 | C++ Distance Transform |

If you are building a commercial or closed-source application and wish to avoid LGPLv3 obligations in your final executable, you have two options:

    Dynamic Linking: Do not use the header-only version of the EDT component. Instead, compile the EDT code into a separate shared library (.so or .dll) and link to it dynamically.

    Replace the Backend: You can replace the files in third_party/edt/ with any other EDT implementation that matches the internal API but carries a permissive license. Alternatively you can modify the API usage in GEMSS_datatypes.hpp -> VoxelGrid -> distance_transform().
